# Provalang
Provalang is an extremely extensible general purpose programming language. Provalang's main purpose is to provide any developer with an easy to use and understand language for any application.
This means that Provalang needs to be easily implemented in any situation to provide support for using it as soon as possible. That also involves an insanely simple foreign function interface coupled with multiple language cross-compilation.
