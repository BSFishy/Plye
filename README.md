# Plye
Plye is an extremely extensible general purpose programming language. Plye's main purpose is to provide any developer with an easy to use and understand language for any application.
This means that Plye needs to be easily implemented in any situation to provide support for using it as soon as possible. That also involves an insanely simple foreign function interface coupled with multiple language cross-compilation.

## Development
At this point in time, Plye is in an extremely early stage in development. It is at no means in a working state. All support and help is extremely appreciated, but until Plye is at least at a beta state, it is not recommended to be used.
